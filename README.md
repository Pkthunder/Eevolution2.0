Eevolution2.0
=============

Updated version of Eevee (aka Eevolution/Eeveelution)

Currently on version 2.2

This is a passion project of mine since the Summer of 2013. I have taught myself HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and jQuery; most of the lessons I have learned have come this game. Simple trial and error. I constantly challenage myself to do things I have never before in both my school and personal projects. For example when I began coding this, I had never used a 3-D Array before, so I, somewhat forced, the use of a 3-D Array into the game. Now I look back and laugh that I ever thought that it was an accomplishment to use one! I don't play around with the code as much as I used to, but I still take a wack at it every now and then. My most recent feat is intergrading the use of a Finite State Machine into the game; That I am actually pretty proud of! - (5/15/2014)
